	<h2> Introducing with the book </h2
	<p> 
		Macbeth (full title The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a tragedy written 
		by William Shakespeare, and is considered 
		one of his darkest and most powerful works. 
		Set in Scotland, the play dramatizes the corrosive 
		psychological and political effects produced when evil is chosen as 
		a way to fulfil the ambition for power.The play is believed
		to have been written between 1599 and 1606,
		and is most commonly dated 1606.
		Macbeth is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy, and tells the story of a 
		brave Scottish general named Macbeth who receives a prophecy from a 
		trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed 
		by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders King Duncan 
		and takes the throne for himself. He is then wracked with guilt and 
		paranoia, and he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler as he is forced to 
		commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion. 
		The bloodbath and consequent civil war swiftly take Macbeth and
		Lady Macbeth into the realms of arrogance, madness, and death.
